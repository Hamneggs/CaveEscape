This is a game I made on and off over the summer, and my ideal
candidate for my main major project this year.

It's called Cave Escape, and is just that--a game where you fly
through a cavern gaining points with distance and pickups.

The game revolves around two polygon meshes detailed by Ken Perlin's
famous noise algorithm, and a single point's tendency to intersect
them.

But to put the game that way is like calling Asshat McGee just an 
asshat!

What you really get to do is fly a teeny-weeny spaceship through
a damn sexy--er, svelt-in-detail cave as the cave begins to close
in and your ship inexplicably speeds up! Sounds fun? No? Well you
must listen to John Anderson as you smash watermelons to amuse
your army of sea urchins. Wait, did I say army? I meant concubine.

At the main menu, you start out with a choice of three game modes:
    -Time Attack: You try to go as far as you can within the time
	limit. Mult pickups pause the clock and point pickups speed
	you up for a bit.
    -Classic:	Collect points with a multiplier, and health pickups
	are plentiful. Best music, lamest gameplay.
    -Survival:  Collect points with a multiplier, but the multplier
	speeds you up, and there are no health pickups. 
*Disclaimer: As of 8-21-12, they're just all classic with different
	music and colors. Differentiation is coming soon.

Next, you arrive at the swanky ship showroom, which is convieniently
located in the cave as well, perhaps because the owner knows there's
a market there, or maybe because it looks cool. 
Just press the left or right arrows to cycle through the ships. Tap
a ship to select it.

Now you're in a gameplay state. You have a health and multiplier 
bar, a score display, and a set of three displays that show the
number of pickups you've collected.
The awesome circle is the joystick. Tap and drag on it. Not hard.

That's it. Have any amount of fun!
